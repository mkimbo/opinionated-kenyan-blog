Hi , I'm Jack!

Im a young kenyan and a tech enthusiast. I created this blog to learn a programming language and ended up
with a platform to air my opinions about the current affairs of our country. I am fed up with the high rate of unemployment,
rampant corruption, mediocre health care, ignorant and arrogant politicians, underrepresentation of youth, women and
people with disabilities, overtaxation of the poor and a million other issues that threaten my success & survival &
that of my immediate society. I have therefore decided to get up,speak out and get involved. I have to raise my voice and
play my part lest this oppressive system crushes my existense.

It is valid to seek out the type of society and country I want. By speaking out I hope to incite a belief of transformational change and
instill generational thinking among Kenyans. We cant wait for someone else to do this for us, we all have to take part in securing our
tommorow and that of our future genrations. We are all we've got. We can use our collective voice and power to create jobs, educate our peers,
elect our peers, get and stay involved in socio-economic and political activation and practices that will see us get the country and the lives we want.
That’s what we must do. For only then, shall we start to see results.

The posts in this blog are going to read like a vaguely-connected set
of thoughts and ideas. I have a habit of writing running sentences and
occasionally going off-topic to introduce a new rant, mid the current
rant that I’m ranting. Basically this whole blog is one big rant,
purely based on my own opinions as a Kenyan youth and a keyboard
warrior. The comments section is open under each post, feel free to
opine about anything. Remember to keep it profesional and dont be
insensitive..
