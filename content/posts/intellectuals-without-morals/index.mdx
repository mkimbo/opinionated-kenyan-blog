Integrity without knowledge is weak and useless, and knowledge without integrity is dangerous and dreadful.
This is what they say at least, and don’t ask me who because I came across this on the internet.In this era of
the World Wide Web, information access has never been easier. Online sources like the search engine Google and
social platforms like Facebook and Twitter means that information on just about anything is readily available
on the press of a button. Information which usually consists of opinions, facts, half-truths, fake news,
propaganda, you know, just EVERYTHING.

You probably know all that already though and since I didnt start this blog to be redundant, I will go straight
to expounding the first sentence of this post. I am dissapointed by some prominent Kenyans in the society,
men and women who are among the best academic brains in the country and possess massive influence
on many aspects that directly affects the lives of Kenyans.

These intellectuals in different academic fields are often the trendsetters for many Kenyans especially youth who look up to
their academic and general success in life. You might think that someone so educated must have acquired most of the
other virtues needed to succeed in life. Virtues you can emulate alongside their academic prowess towards succeeding
in life but that is not the case. In fact, you are in for a rude shock when you see some of these intellectuals for who they really are.

Twitter, a micro-blogging platform has been flooded by Kenyans in the recent past making it a hub for all kinds of people and
information. It is here that I have been able to understand who some of these intellectuals really are under their
veils of academic success. I recently confronted a renowned economist, “the best in Kenya” as KOT have labeled him on
his political orientation after he recently switched allegiances and started campaigning for a certain “hustler”.
He has been busy selling this hustler’s propaganda to Kenyans on twitter, the same politician he called a conman and a
thief some time back on the same platform. He blocked me some moments later after I showed him the tweet (he had deleted
it – but the internet NEVER forgets) where he had called out the same man he is now telling Kenyans is the best option for
presidency in next year’s general election.

The guy even goes ahead to unapologetically and arrogantly state that he is supporting a conman and a thief for his own interests!!
I mean, it’s a free world and you can support anyone you want in an election, but why push agendas that you know very
well are false and mere campaign strategies? Why lie to millions of Kenyans who are suffering because of unmet promises made by
politicians? His twitter account has almost a million followers, to put that into perspective, around 15 million people
voted in the 2017 elections which means he is lying and trying to persuade almost 7% of potential voters to vote for
someone he knows very well is not fit to lead this country!! And mind you he has already done it before when he was
a propagandist for another tumbocrat commonly referred to as “Baba”. This makes him no different from the cheap influencers
on twitter who get hired to push ill-motivated hashtags, a liar for hire.

And he is not alone, there are a lot of these intellectuals of his ilk all over Kenya. Some have massive followings on their social
media accounts and they take advantage of this to misinform people for their own selfish interests. These are the same people many
Kenyans are proposing for leadership positions assuming that the intelligence they possess will be enough to take the country forward.
Contrary to this popular belief, very few kenyan leaders are not learned. Most of the top tier politicians in the country
are actually very well educated individuals including lawyers,doctors,engineers etc. The decisions and policies
they make though will leave you wondering whether or not education is really fulfilling its purpose in Kenya. From these intellectuals,
it is clear that being intelligent alone is not enough to be a leader, Kenya needs selfless political and societal leaders with high levels of intergrity
and the ones we have are nowhere near those levels despite being educated.

I believe the sentiment that one of the chief aims of education is to save man from the morass of propaganda,
prejudices and half-truths. Even though illiteracy levels among the youth are low,it’s sad seeing that even after spending more
than 12 years in school many youths are still finding it difficult to think critically, sift and weigh
information. Many are still easily swayed by false promises from politicians, tribalism and "mtu wetu" politics.
Our current crop of leaders and some of the so-called intellectuals in the society are proving that the only thing
they acquired from education are instruments of exploitation which they are using to trample over the masses.

If we are not careful in discerning the truth from half-truths, facts from propaganda, political ideologies from campaign strategies,
we will always be led by the same group of close-minded, selfish, illogical propagandists who are consumed with immoral acts
that benefit their individual interests. Be careful, brethren! Be careful, Kenyans!
