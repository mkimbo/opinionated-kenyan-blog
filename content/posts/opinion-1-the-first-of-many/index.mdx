Hello Folks,

This is the first of a long list of posts I hope to write touching on various issues that I encounter and experience as a Kenyan Youth.
I have wanted to write this blog for a while and I'm really excited I finally got it up running up to this point. By writing this blog I
intend to express my experiences and understandings on several topics that concern us as Kenyans. Our current affairs as a country are a
total mess and coupled with the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic we face imminent meltdown in all aspects unless we take action.

Throughout this blog, my posts will be centered around 3 categories as I try to relate to them and raise awareness with the hope of effecting
change in each one. These will be SOCIETY, LEADERSHIP and GOVERNANCE.I believe that transformational change in these three wide areas will set
Kenya on a path to success in different sectors.

## #Leadership

At a time when our leaders have turned a blind eye on their duties and their citizens, kenyans need to come together and demand for change.
We need to hold them accountable for all their actions and inactions, and the only way to do so is to elect ONLY leaders of intergrity. We need
selfless leaders not power hungry politicians, people of character who will put the interests of ALL kenyans before their own interests or that
of their family or tribe. We have to stop voting along ethnic lines because it doesnt matter if the president comes from your tribe, horrendous
policies and poverty will affect people of all tribes. We need to sift through the lies and fake promises politicians make and choose leaders
with realistic manifestos and ideologies.

## #Society

We have to effect changes in our society too. We have to openly speak about issues like gender-based violence, mental health, drug abuse and
teenage pregnancies. All these are issues that are hitting so close to home we cant avoid them and act like they dont exist.We have to get our
hands dirty and do the groundwork ourselves. Societies are made up of individuals, you and I. Therefore, effective change has to start with
each one of us, we all have to take part in this for it to work. We all have to get involved in providing real solutions to real problems in our
immediate surroundings.

## #Governance

There is a fine line between Leadership and Governance especially on the context of this blog, but the difference is there. Kenya has a very
large number of public servants holding public offices. With such a vast human resource, its mind blowing how we still have massive underrepresentation
especially for youth, women and people with disabilities. Massive corruption scandals right under the noses of the Executive and failure of the Judiciary
to prosecute cases are all down to bad governance. We need to provide ideas to those holding public offices on how they can better govern and provide
better services to all Kenyans. We need to have more forums like #EngageTheIG where public servants ask ordinary kenyans on how better they can be serviced.
Posts on this category will mostly go hand in hand with Leadership and when they are not it will be me doing the #If-I-Was-President-For-A-Day challenge
where I would suggest on how I would do things differently for a change.

### The youth in all this...

Young people around the world are an untapped force for making the world a better place and Kenyan youth are no exception. We should never
doubt the influence of our own voices and power.We need to speak up and be heard, we need to take a stand and get involved on important
matters that affect our society and our country. We need to ask for chances, be given chances and take these chances by the scruff of the
neck so that those at the policy-making level can stop stereotyping us as "too young" or "inexperienced". Young people are not just the leaders of
tommorow, we are also leaders of today and we need seats at the high tables.
