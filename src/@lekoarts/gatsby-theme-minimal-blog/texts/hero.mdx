This is the time Kenyans need to take a stand and speak up. We are not doing well
as a country in all sectors, and we have to raise awareness and inspire belief that
will have a catalytic impact all over the country. A belief that tranformational
change is possible in every aspect of our lives as Kenyans. Bad governance coupled
with rampant corruption and glaring societal flaws have stagnated our growth as a
country. I started this blog to air my opinions and experiences as a Kenyan youth.
I want to speak up with the hope of inspiring my fellow youth and all kenyans to
wake up and reclaim Kenya from the shackles of corruption, tribalism and a barrel
of issues that hinder us from becoming the prosperous nation we can be.
